This is a vanilla Next14 App Router + React18 web app, ready to deploy to Vercel with a handful of clicks.

The UX works fine for me, and data is stored in Vercel's experimental `Edge Config Store`, which is so low-impact that it might as well be free forever. If you need more scale, portability, or ease of use, consider another of Vercel's data stores, Sqlite on Turso, Redis on Upstash, or Mongo/Postgres via different hosts that compete for developer attention.

The repo also specifies a development Neynar API key. Replace this with your own key before deploying to `PROD`. The Neynar docs are very clear about how to do this.

### Development

```
pnpm i
pnpm run dev
```

Head to <http://localhost:3000/api>

### Deploy to Vercal

Commit to Github, link in Vercel, click and deploy.

After the first  deployment, you must connect a Vercel `Edge Config Store` database to this project and re-deploy. Easiest is via the Dashboard, and it can also be done via the CLI.
